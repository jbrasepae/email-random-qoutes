“You have brains in your head. You have feet in your shoes. You can steer yourself any direction you choose. You're on your own. And you know what you know. And YOU are the one who'll decide where to go...”“It is never too late to be what you might have been.”“I have not failed. I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work.”“Life isn't about finding yourself. Life is about creating yourself.”“Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts.”
